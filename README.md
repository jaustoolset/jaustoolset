# jaustoolset

The JAUS ToolSet is Java-based tool for the creation (or import) of interfaces for robotic systems based on the JAUS Service Interface Definition Language (JSIDL) as published by the SAE AS-4 committee. Once created (or imported), the toolset can be used to generate C++, Java, or C# code as well as documentation in HTML or Word formats.

The toolset also includes run-time components like the Node Manager, based on the open-source JR Middleware, for handling network transport responsibilities.

Please consult the documentation in **GUI/docs/JTS_UsersGuide.pdf** for set-up and usage instructions.

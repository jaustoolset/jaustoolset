    # It is recommended that you maintain default settings.
    #
    # Note that several parameters apply per API connection (that is, the
    # settings apply for each communication client) and others
    # apply per Run-Time Engine instance.  The RTE may be started manually
    # prior to connection requests from clients; otherwise, the RTE
    # will be started automatically by the first connecting client.

    <!-- 
        The following settings apply for each client connection.  
        # By default, Jr maintains a history buffer of incoming messages for two reasons:
        #  1) To detect duplicate messages
        #  2) To reconstruct large messages that have been parsed into
        #     multiple packets.
        # The history buffer needs to be finite in size, so that excessive
        # memory is not consumed.  The MaxMsgHistory marks the maximum message
        # size that the history is allowed to store at any one time.  The OldMsgTimeout
        # marks an age, in seconds, at which a message is removed from the history.
        # These values may need to be increased for particularly slow connections.
        
        # By default, Junior will detect a message that is received twice at a 
        # particular destination.  This often occurs in complex networks, in which
        # a message may be routed to an end-point over two different paths.  
        # This behavior can be deactived with the DropDuplicateMsgs flag.
        
        # Junior splits large messages into discrete packets for 
        # transport, similar to IP's implementation of MTU (maximum
        # transfer size).  The default value of 4079 is defined by JAUS,
        # and works for most IP and wired serial.  Many 902-928 radios 
        # have smaller buffers, however, requiring that messages are
        # broken up more than JAUS dictates.  The MTU_Size is the number
        # of bytes, excluding the header bytes added by Junior, that
        # may be sent in any single packet.
                
        # It is also possible to configure the maximum number of times to resend 
        # a message marked for Guarenteed Delivery
        # that was not acknowledged by the receiver.  The message is sent a total
        # of (MaxAckNakRetries+1), as the first send is not considered a retry.  
        # AckTimeout is the period, in milliseconds, to wait before resending a message.

        # is written to the given file.  Otherwise, it's displayed in a text window.
        
        # Junior supports up to 5 levels of logging.  Each increase in logging level

        # By default, Junior provides relay services to increase the scope of
        # wireless networks.  This service does use additional bandwidth, and

        # in bandwidth limited situations.

        # The Junior RTE runs cyclically as a background application to ensure
        # smooth routing and delivery of messages.  To avoid overloading the CPU,
        # the period of executation can be adjusted by the "RTE_CycleTime" parameter.
        # This sleep time is measured in milliseconds.  A high value frees up more
        # system resources for other tasks, but increases the latency in the

        # The MaxBufferSize denotes that maximum size, in bytes, of the send
        # and receive buffers for socket communication.  A large value
        # allows for large or frequent messages to be passed without
        # loss; however, more system resources are required.  If the middleware

        # this value.
        
        # The UseOPC2.75_Header flag is maintained for backward compatibility with previous 
        # versions of JAUS.  A value of 1 replaces the JUDP header defined 
        # by SAE AS-5669 with the JAUS 2.75 OPC header (JAUS01.0) for all 
        # network communications.  The OPC format is not standard, however, 
        # and should be used with caution.
        
        # By default, Junior uses the port reserved for JAUS as assigned
        # by the IANA for all UDP traffic.  Changing the UDP_Port 
        # assignment is not recommended.
        
        # Junior implements broadcast through UDP multicast in order to 
        # provide limits on the proliferation of broadcast messages.  The Time
        # To Live, or TTL, can be set to limit the number of routers a broadcast
        # may pass through before it is restricted.  Increasing this value
        # will increase proliferation of a broadcast on a network.
        # Furthermore, Junior restricts broadcasts to a multicast IP address.

        # independent of each other.  Note that systems must have the same

        For each serial interface, several parameters are required:
        
        # SerialPortName:  Set the name of the serial port for Junior to use.  
        #        For Windows, this is usually of the form "COMn" where n is a

        #        where n is a number between 0 and 7.
        #
        # SerialBaudRate: Select the serial BAUD rate.
        #
        # SerialParity & SerialStopBits:
        #         Junior will use 8 bits for data transmission, and this
        #         value is not configurable.  The parity and number of stop bits is configurable,
        #         and must match the remote device settings to ensure data is not corrupted.
        #         By default, Junior uses no parity, and 1 stop bit.  This is often referred to
        #         as "8N1".  Parity may take the value of: even, odd, or none.  Stop bits may have
        #         a value of 1 or 2.

        #        device is ready to write or receive data.  This is called hardware 
        #        flow control.  Alternatively, software flow control can be used, 
        #        but is much less efficient.  The following configuration item should

        For UDP and serial connections, Jr can automatically find other
        nodes to communicate with.  However, TCP connections do not 
        support such discovery.  The AddressBook allows a client to be
        preconfigured with a list of IDs and their associated ip address
        and port number.  All entries must be of the form:
            J<id number> = "<ip_address>:<port>"
            
        Note the preceeding "J" must be inserted before the integer ID.

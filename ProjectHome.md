JTS is designed to support the modeling, analyzing, specifying, implementing, simulating and testing of the protocol for distributed systems. It provides robotic system developers with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for designing standard JAUS SOA software. This will reduce the learning curve time for new organizations to begin using the Toolset. JTS will automatically generate specification documents and source code for the designs. The generated code will allow robot application developers to integrate their software into the design service architecture, without having to write any SOA layer code directly. Additionally, JTS enables validation of the user designs automatically within the GUI, to ensure the resulting services will be interoperable and produce the desired system behavior.
